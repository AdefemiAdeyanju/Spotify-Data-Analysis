# Spotify-Data-Analysis

This project was undertaken to analyze spotify track dataset using python.

## Project Steps

### Step 1 - Data Collection

*I collected the dataset from kaggle.

*I imported the dataset using the pd.read_csv method.

### Step2 - Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

*I derived basic information from the above collected data using the .info() and .head() methods.

*I checked for null values.

*I inspected the dataset for basic information using the .info() and .describe() methods.

*I checked for the least popular songs.

*I checked the dataset description using the describe().transpose method.

*I checked for the most popular songs.

*I set release date as index.

*I located an artiste using the .iloc method.

*I inspected the duration column using the .head() method.

*I sampled the dataset.

*I converted date column to datetime format.

*I imported the second dataset.

*I derived basic information from the above collected data using the .info() and .head() methods.


### Step3 - Data Visualization

*I plotted a correlation between variable using heatmap visualization.

*I plotted a regression plot between loudness and energy.

*I plotted a regression plot between popularity and acousticness.

*I plotted the number of songs per year using a histplot.

*I ploted the top 5 genres by popularity in the second dataset on a barplot.
